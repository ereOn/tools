My personal set of tools.

What is this repository ?
-------------------------

This repository contains all the tools and configurations that I use on a daily basis.

It contains bash configurations and git extensions tools as well as other tips I want to remember.

Feel free to clone/modify these scripts and configurations as much as you like. Also if you spot an error or a security risk, please let me know !

Contents
--------

The `git` directory contains git extension tools and modules, mostly written in Python.
